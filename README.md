# customer_behaviour_analysis
This is a customer behavior analysis project built using SQL and PostgreSQL. The project focuses on analyzing customer data to understand revenue trends, product performance, and purchase patterns. All the analysis is performed using SQL queries executed in pgAdmin, helping to practice real-world data analysis and improve SQL querying skills.

Data Analytics Project
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from loading a dataset in Python to building an interactive dashboard in Power BI. The objective of the project is to analyze data, clean and transform it, extract insights using SQL, and present the findings in a clear and visual manner.

📂 Dataset

The project uses a structured dataset containing business-related information such as customer details, transactions, and performance metrics.

Dataset tasks include:

Loading data using Python

Understanding data structure and data types

Handling missing values and inconsistencies

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)

Power BI

Jupyter Notebook

pgAdmin / SQL client

🔄 Project Workflow / Steps
1️⃣ Data Loading

Loaded the dataset into Python using Pandas

Performed initial data inspection and validation

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed data distributions and trends

Identified missing values and outliers

Generated basic visualizations to understand patterns

3️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing and incorrect values

Standardized column names and data formats

Prepared clean data for analysis and database loading

4️⃣ SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into a relational database

Ran SQL queries to answer business questions such as:

Revenue analysis

Customer segmentation

Product performance

Used joins, aggregations, filtering, and subqueries

5️⃣ Dashboard Development

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard

Visualized key metrics and insights
